- Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

- Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.
Interpreted in simple terms means running code line by line. It also means that the instruction is executed without earlier compiling the whole program into machine language.
